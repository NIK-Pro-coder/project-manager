## PyProjectManager
A little python script that helps manage projects and ideas

#### Description:
PyProjectManager is a simple and easy to use project managing software that aims to abstract boring thing like doing commits and installing packages away from the developer.

It offers a variety of tools to aid in the development of software, for example it provides a simple and efficent way to manage todos.

It also has a few silly little features like motivational quotes displayed using cowsay (if it is installed) and a few minigames, such as:
 - 2048
 - Mastermind
 - Memory
 - That's it really
